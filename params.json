{"body":"# platypus.js\r\n\r\nExperimental JavaScript loader.\r\n\r\n## What is this?\r\nFor now only a proof of concept that you can load both CSS and JavaScript with only one request.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you hide your JavaScript code inside your CSS, load the CSS file, extract the JavaScript code and execute it.\r\n\r\n## Seriously?\r\n**Yes!** Look into `experiments` folder too see the examples, also read `experiments/README.md` for details.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nFirstly: why not? Secondly: to remove as many requests as possible & make things faster.\r\n\r\n## Now what?\r\nSo far I have proven that this new technique works. Now I need to determine which version is better, pack the code into something more generic and make it work on different browsers (I've only tested in Chrome for now). And before that I should probably run some benchmarks to determine if this is really faster than the \"traditional\" way of including CSS&JS files.\r\n\r\n## Platypus?\r\nWell it's a [funny animal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus) that's half duck and half beaver (well not actually). And this project is trying to join two different things into one â€¦ so platypus.","note":"Don't delete this file!
